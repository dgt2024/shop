		<p id="self">
			Hi!, I'm Dave, a 13 year old student and self-taught coder who knows
			quite a lot, if you take into account my age. I built this website
			myself, by hand, all the HTML, CSS and JS; And all the games in this
			website, using C++/SFML.
			<br><br>
			Please if any of my games are bad, you can tell me or contact me for me
			to fix it altough, honestly, talking about older games, there will be
			less probability of me fixing it...
			<br><br>
			I would love if you game me some feedback in the review tab so I can be
			better in my coding career so when I am bigger I can show off my skills
			using this website as "Time Machine" :D
			<br><br>
			Also I'm very good at math, I'm learning Quantum Mechanics and some
			Thermodynamics here and there. Also, there's an easter egg in this site
			so let's see who finds it first...
		</p>
		<p id="pl-title">Programming Languages</p>
		<div id="pl-items">
			<div id="pl-asm"><b>Assembly</b><p>
				I made a full operating system with GUI, apps, and my own file
				system, and I've also had about 1.5 years of experience.
			</p></div>
			<div id="pl-cpp"><b>C++</b><p>
				I have a lot more experience with C++ (Some codes dating back to
				2022, when I was 10), and honestly, seeing back, I am
				flabberghasted of seeing how many games and progress I've made
				since then
			</p></div>
			<div id="pl-html"><b>HTML</b><p>
				I mean my HTML progress mostly comes down to when I begun coding
				which was in 2021/2022 (altough I've coded a lot more in C++ and
				assembly, I have also coded in HTML, such as this website).
			</p></div>
			<div id="pl-css"><b>CSS</b><p>
				If I'm being honest, I've also had my connection with CSS but
				during the creation of this website I've seen I use more CSS than
				HTML (a lot more than I would have ever imagined).
			</p></div>
			<div id="pl-js"><b>JavaScript</b><p>
				I have not much had a lot with JavaScript, as I'm not much into web
				development (also because I haven't coded much in it, Fun Fact: this
				website has no JavaScript code).
			</p></div>
			<div id="pl-java"><b>Java</b><p>
				I'm surprised how much Java brings to the table, and I've done some
				minecraft mods here and there, but not much either, just like
				JavaScript.
